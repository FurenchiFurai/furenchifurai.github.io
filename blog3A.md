### Topic - Virtual Reality (VR)

This week I decided to talk about **V**irtual **R**eality (VR) because I am taking another class which deals with UX/UI design and the project we decided to do was something that dealt with VR

I believe VR is a growing technology that is quite underdeveloped since it reguires a system that can actually power the application and make it stable enough fo the the enduser to be comfortable.

We will also go over the types of hardware that VR requires besides a working computer (mainly headsets and controllers)

#### What exactly is Virtual Reality?

The direct definition of Virtual Reality off [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_reality) is "a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. Applications of virtual reality can include entertainment (i.e. video games) and educational purposes (i.e. medical or military training). Other, distinct types of VR style technology include augmented reality and mixed reality."

In very basic terms, Virtual Reality is a simulation that can be interacted with using the touch, sight and sound. The simulation is seperate from the real world and besides designated areas for movement, rarely uses the surrounding areas of the user.

This is a stark contrast to **A**ugmented **R**eality (**AR**) which according to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augmented_reality) is "an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory."

What differentiates **AR** to **VR** is that **AR** creates a computer simulation on top of the real world environment as a way to "interact" with the computer simulation. Currently this is the more developed technology as the technology only requires a multiple camera system to correctly gauge depth.  From this, majority of multiple len smartphones these days are able to simulate **AR** to create new interactive methods for entertainment and media.
