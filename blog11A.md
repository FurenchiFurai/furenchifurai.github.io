### Topic - IoT (Internet of Things)

With the annoucnement of the newest iPhone SE, I've had a good amount of family members ask about it and were talking about also maybe getting Apple Watches or iPads and this led to me to think about IoT.  With the current conviniences of current technology, there are abundant amounts of devices that are now miniature computer that process a large amount of information for us. I will be talking about what is IoT, well known devices and how it is more affected by security concerns.

#### What is IoT?

So while stated above in the title, IoT stands for **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings, which according to [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) is "system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction ... most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the 'smart home', covering devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers"  

So in a more simple approach, any device that is able to transmit data over a network without human involvement is considered part of the IoT.  And as stated in the latter half of the definition, the majority of people already use IoT devices, in one way or another since with growing technology and cheaper costs to make computer chips, companies started integrating computer chips to improve productivity and to create ease of access with their devices.

#### What are common devices?

So since IoT is so integral to the majority of people, there are very common devices that are used daily where I will be talking about why and how they are integral to daily use.

**Speakers/Assistants**
- So most people are familiar with Amazon Echo or Apple's Siri or even Google Home, which are basically "personal" assistants for people to ask questions or run commands. For example, you can ask them to give you information of a search on the web or request the time or weather at your location or another. This creates conveniences where users do not have to necessarily have a device thats capable of accessing the internet on them to get information around them. In a majority of the next few devices, a speaker/assistant is usually the trigger that lets these devices do their job

**"Smart" Accessories**
- Alongside the assistant, most people probably have a wide variety of small appliances that have multiple sensors which aid in specific areas of the house.
1. **Lightbulbs**: I would say these are the most common and well known as there are a variety of sensors that are deployed which have many options like turning off or on, changing color, or even motion detection. All these sensors help with creating a more "lazy" enviroment for people to live in. Most of the options on the market use a smartphone to control it, but some are compatible with assistants as well.

2. **Outlets**: These are add-ons to current power outlets which let them control the flow of electricity to devices connected to them. For example, if you wanted to turn on a standalone fan or humidifier or appliance, you could send a signal like a clap or smartphone and the appliance would be able to power on without you moving an inch of where you were.

3. **Locks**: As security seems to be a big issue today, sometimes a remote option is useful. With smart locks, you can make sure you have locked your doors through checking it status on their repective apps. Less hassle and worry when you know your home is secured.

4. **Doorbell**: Similarly as above, smart doorbells check to see movement at the door they positioned at and record any activity when they are activated or when they sense movement in front of the camera. These are probably the second most common device as many households use them to thwart annoying suitors and to check for packages that may come in the mail.

5. **Thermostat**: This device usually is integrated into newer houses as it is easier to and more efficient to keep the electrical bill down when you can control the temperature of your home in a direct manner wherever you are.

#### How is IoT affected by security?

As stated before, all of these devices are constantly monitoring and gathering data since their sensors are tuned to be ready for any needed activity which means they are often targets of security attacks. From this, there is always an underlying tone of how secure are the devices I am purchasing, as it will determine whether it is worth the convenience. For the most part, things like the a good portion of the smart accessories I posted above gather data that is more likely than not useless to potential hacker. Things such as how many times the light was turned off, is not something I would say is fairly flawed and can be taken advantage of. However, because of the increasing amount of IoT devices being created and sold to consumers, I think that security for these products is needed more than ever.
