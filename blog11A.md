### Topic - IoT (Internet of Things)

With the annoucnement of the newest iPhone SE, I've had a good amount of family members ask about it and were talking about also maybe getting Apple Watches or iPads and this led to me to think about IoT.  With the current conviniences of current technology, there are abundant amounts of devices that are now miniature computer that process a large amount of information for us. I will be talking about what is IoT, well known devices and how it is more affected by security concerns.

#### What is IoT?

So while stated above in the title, IoT stands for **I**nternet **o**f **T**hings, which according to [wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) is "system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction ... most synonymous with products pertaining to the concept of the 'smart home', covering devices and appliances (such as lighting fixtures, thermostats, home security systems and cameras, and other home appliances) that support one or more common ecosystems, and can be controlled via devices associated with that ecosystem, such as smartphones and smart speakers"  

So in a more simple approach, any device that is able to transmit data over a network without human involvement is considered part of the IoT.  And as stated in the latter half of the definition, the majority of people already use IoT devices, in one way or another since with growing technology and cheaper costs to make computer chips, companies started integrating computer chips to improve productivity and to create ease of access with their devices.
