### Lab 1, troubles with dockerfile configuration

So running through the first lab was pretty simple, just throwing each command into the terminal and seeing the output, not many issues and the application was shown correct on the page. Easy peasy LAMP stack.

Now it was time to configure the Dockerfile, to encompass the whole lab, so that another user could `scp` it into their own docker container and generate the same webpage in one motion. 

Using the new instructions of not needing to clone the project makes it much more doable. The majority of the Dockerfile was installing the main components of the LAMP stack (Apache, MySQL and PHP) which shouldn't be difficult (keyword is "shouldn't").

The main difficulty for me was editing the `.conf` files so the whole thing goes smoothly. I am not too good with the `sed` command so I guess the rest of the weekend is getting good at using `sed` to edit the `.conf` files correctly.




### Other things in life (mainly gaming)

Borderlands 3 came out this week, and watching the gameplay of that is really tempting me to get it, however I am not fond of the game launcher that they are currently exclusive on, so for now I will wait till it comes on Steam.  

Overwatch League is having the quarterfinals and semifinals this week, and it looks like the power rankings for the previous few weeks are up for grabs since every team can lose or fail in full sweeps.  This season has been very interesting to watch.
