### Lab 1, troubles with dockerfile configuration

So running through the first lab was pretty simple, just throwing each command into the terminal and seeing the output, not many issues and application was shown correct on the page.  

Now it was time to configure the Dockerfile, to encompass the whole lab, so that another user could `scp` it into their own docker repository and generate the same webpage in one motion. 



### Other things in life

Borderlands 3 came out this week, and watching the gameplay of that is really tempting me to get it, however I am not fond of the game launcher that they are currently exclusive on, so for now I will wait till it comes on Steam.  

Overwatch League is having the quarterfinals and semifinals this week, and it looks like the power rankings for the previous few weeks are up for grabs since every team can lose or fail in full sweeps.  This season has been very interesting to watch.
