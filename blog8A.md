### Topic - Imaging

Currently while I am working from home, I have some training I do during the downtime that is focused into Office 365 and one of the topics they talked about was different methods of how to deploy multiple desktops for a company/organization. One of the things that caught my attention was "Imaging" which was a more manual method but can be beneficial or easier to understand to the end user. Today I will be talking about imaging and what it basically is and how to leverage it to maximize deployment.
