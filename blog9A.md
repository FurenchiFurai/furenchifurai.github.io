### Topic - Printers

Since I seem to have ran out of topics I can quickly think about, I decided to go back into hardware, and one of the things I have not talked about yet is printers. Whiie not as used as conmputers, printers play a vital part of changing the digital to the physical and are still important in modern society as a method of validation (contracts, reports, etc).  For this topic I will attemp to explain how printers work and explain their other features (fax, copy, scan) which make them a big part of modern computers.

#### What is a printer?

To start with the definition from [computerhope](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/printer.htm) a printer is "A printer is an external hardware output device that takes the electronic data stored on a computer or other device and generates a hard copy of it". Basically it is a device seperate from the computer that takes specific file types and converts them to a physical copy using ink/paper (or with the new 3D printers, plasic/metal filament). I would say a good majoirty of people have used a printer at least once in their lifetime, to process their files (documents, taxes, powerpoints, etc).

The simple history of a printer starts with the printing press, which was basically a large machine with exchangable metal letters arranged to match the document being copied, and those letters are embossed out and dipped into ink, then pressed to a paper equivalent. This made it so text can be distributed easily for the common folk. The first real modern printer was more in tune as a buffed up typewriter as it was more mechanical and did not require human interference but still was not as efficient as the old printing press. As years went by, the use of printers started to dwindle as there were more options to store documents so physical copies of the file became dependant on the situation.  However current printers are fairly advanced and there are multiple different types.

The first is liquid inkjet, which is probably the most common printer that everyone knows, where the printer head nozzle is fed liquid ink in the CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, key or black) and then sprayed directly onto the paper in bursts. This method is relatively slower as it has to do a couple pixels at a time, and printing multiple pages can increase the time to a staggering amount. Another is the solid ink printer, where sticks of CMYK wax ink is melted and sprayed onto a drum where then a paper is rolled over and is transfered the ink. Usually has very good results, and is mainly used in office color printers. Only downside to this is that the wax ink is not easy to write on. The dye-sublimation printer is a bit more special as it uses heat to transfer the ink to paper through panels and is more suited to color photography rather than text based. Probably the most well known but also unknown is the thermal printers, which also use heat but on heat specific paper. The most common form of thermal printer is the monochrome, which is used as receipt printers for any establishment selling items. The final method is toner-based printing or laser printing, where powdered toner is electrically charged and a cyclinder is lasered to create zones of different electrical charge in which the powder gets heated and then is adhered to the paper.
