### Topic - Computer Mice

So following the trend of the past weeks I will continue to talk about hardware and specifically I will be talking about computer mice. Throughout the years they have gone through multiple different changes but the main concept of the device is still the same: to be able to pinpoint certain aspects of user interface and interact with it. 

Some disclosure, there really is not any different "styles" of mice except for their form factor, which is usually differentiated through comfortability or ergonomic features to lessen pressure on areas of the wrist.  The closest variation would be a touch pad that laptops have but technically they are not mice so I will not be including them in this blog (maybe a different one ....)

Because of what I stated in the previous paragraph I will talk about history and changes in how the mice receives external data through the evolution of sensors.
