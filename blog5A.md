### Topic - Computer Mice

So following the trend of the past weeks I will continue to talk about hardware and specifically I will be talking about computer mice. Throughout the years they have gone through multiple different changes but the main concept of the device is still the same: to be able to pinpoint certain aspects of user interface and interact with it. 

Some disclosure, there really is not any different "styles" of mice except for their form factor, which is usually differentiated through comfortability or ergonomic features to lessen pressure on areas of the wrist.  The closest variation would be a touch pad that laptops have but technically they are not mice so I will not be including them in this blog (maybe a different one ....)

Because of what I stated in the previous paragraph I will talk about history and changes in how the mice receives external data through the evolution of sensors.

#### Evolution of the computer mice

The original ideas of a precision controlled device was mainly done with a trackball or "joystick" styled control. This was not very precise and is stated to be "not elegant" so then the first concept of a mouse was created (shown in above image). This design used 2 wheels, to control a cursor in a very strict x-y plane. Basically the cursor would be moving along only one axis at one time, and was very clunky but did the job and was improved in the next iteration of computer mice .

This is the second iteration of computer mouse evolution, a more sleeker form factor which is rounded to be easily gripped and has a ball on which rolls around when moving. The input from the ball is translated into a smaller form of the wheel form from the previous iteration and is read by passing a small beam of light between slots in the wheels which triggers the compact circuitry to pass into the computer. This lead to a slightly more smooth and accurate tracking of the cursor onto the UI. The flaws of this design was mainly the rubber ball on the bottom which had to be free-floating to be able to read input easily, but this led to things be able to stuck inside and prevent the ball from rolling, or jam the wheels which would make the mouse useless.

To fix the issues with reading the rubber ball, a newer technology for mouse sensors was created, the optical sensor. This newer sensor fixed a majority of the issues that the physical sensors faced, which was dust and debris. The new sensor used a reflecting light beam to check the surface that the mouse is on. This entire sensor is enclosed into the mouse and has no moving parts so dust and debris usually only makes the sensor a little unresponsive but cannot completely disable the sensor like the rubber ball. However the main downside of the optical sensor is that it cannot track well on transparent surfaces. Because of how the light beam is bounced of opaque surfaces, when using on tables that are transparent, like glass, the beam has nothing to bounce off of so there is a high chance that the mouse will stop responding to movements unless you move it to a opaque/solid surface.
