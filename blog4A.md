### Topic - Computer Monitor Panels

So a little pre-cursor for this topic, I had a friend had to get special glasses after working on the computer for so long so I decided to talk about something that a majority of people look at daily, computer monitors.

As an IT/Computer Science person, I use a computer monitor on the daily. Whether it is at work, or playing games at home, doing homework or even writing this blog I am staring at a screen, almost 10 hours a day and over time it does strain my eyes. Because of this I feel it is good to know what panels are in the monitors that we are looking at every day.

Through a little bit of research, there are 3 main types of LCD panels that are found in the majority of consumer computer monitors: Twisted Nematic (**TN**), Vertical Alignment (**VA**), and In-Plane Switching (**IPS**). I will be talking about what are the pros and cons of each and the technology behind each panel.

#### Twisted Nematic (TN)

TN panels use a technology described on [monitornerds.com](https://www.monitornerds.com/different-monitor-panel-types-a-simple-guide/) "work by passing light through two polarized screens, a color filter and liquid crystals that tend to twist and block light in correspondence of the current applied to them. This type of an arrangement leaves a lot in your hands as you can change the amount of current applied to adjust the crystal twists. Hence, you can achieve virtually any color or shade reproduced on the screen"

Basically, light is controlled by a twisting motion (hence the name) between a color filter and liquid crystals (**LC** of the LCD) and that creates a wide variety of colors and hues with immense control over what is shown. 

These panels are usually cheaper and more affordable and take up a majority of the market since they are easier and less costly to manufacture.  But because of this there are some negatives that cannot be overlooked. TN panels use a 6-bit channel which equates to 64 shades of colors, which contrasts the 8-bit channel that can output 256 shades of color (the max amount aka the RGB 256,256,256). This usually leads to less color accuracy and when viewed at a narrow angle (aka from the side) the colors apppear "washed" and dull.

Pro: cheap for the quality
Con: cheap for the quality
