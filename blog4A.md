### Topic - Computer Monitor Panels

So a little pre-cursor for this topic, I had a friend had to get special glasses after working on the computer for so long so I decided to talk about something that a majority of people look at daily, computer monitors.

As an IT/Computer Science person, I use a computer monitor on the daily. Whether it is at work, or playing games at home, doing homework or even writing this blog I am staring at a screen, almost 10 hours a day and over time it does strain my eyes. Because of this I feel it is good to know what panels are in the monitors that we are looking at every day.

Through a little bit of research, there are 3 main types of LCD panels that are found in the majority of consumer computer monitors: Twisted Nematic (**TN**), Vertical Alignment (**VA**), and In-Plane Switching (**IPS**). I will be talking about what are the pros and cons of each and the technology behind each panel.

#### Twisted Nematic (TN)

TN panels use a technology described on [monitornerds.com](https://www.monitornerds.com/different-monitor-panel-types-a-simple-guide/) "... work by passing light through two polarized screens, a color filter and liquid crystals that tend to twist and block light in correspondence of the current applied to them. This type of an arrangement leaves a lot in your hands as you can change the amount of current applied to adjust the crystal twists. Hence, you can achieve virtually any color or shade reproduced on the screen ..."

Basically, light is controlled by a twisting motion (hence the name) between a color filter and liquid crystals (**LC** of the LCD) and that creates a wide variety of colors and hues with immense control over what is shown. 

These panels are usually cheaper and more affordable and take up a majority of the market since they are easier and less costly to manufacture.  But because of this there are some negatives that cannot be overlooked. TN panels use a 6-bit channel which equates to 64 shades of colors, which contrasts the 8-bit channel that can output 256 shades of color (the max amount aka the RGB 256,256,256). This usually leads to less color accuracy and when viewed at a narrow angle (aka from the side) the colors apppear "washed" and dull.

**PROS**: cheap for the quality

**CONS**: cheap for the quality

#### In-Plane Switching (IPS)

IPS panels use technology described on [monitornerds.com](https://www.monitornerds.com/different-monitor-panel-types-a-simple-guide/) as "... use polarized filters, liquid crystals, and transmitters. However, in this case, the arrangement is different. The liquid crystals in an IPS panel design are aligned in a way that allows less light to distort and achieves better color visibility ..."

Simply put, the technology created was used to combat the issues of TN panels, which was basically color accuracy and poor viewing angles.  Each pixel requires multiple transmitters and liquid crystals which exponentially increase the better the resolution on the monitor.  As stated above the 8-bit channel creates the max amount of shades for color, and IPS panels were the pioneer for that usage with each panel getting the best color accuracy at all angles. 

Because of this technology and its complexity, the cost for the IPS panels in much much higher compared to TN. Over the years, this has dropped but usually for the same specs, an IPS panel will at least be double the price of a TN panel.

**PROS**: better color accuracy and viewing angles

**CONS**: cost

#### Vertical Alignment (VA)

Unfortunately this monitor's technology is very brief and there is not much out on the market, the thing to take away from this panel is that it has a very similar color accuracy to IPS but boasts a better refresh rate similar to a TN panel. Basically the VA panels take only the best from both TN and IPS and create a solid middle ground option.

**PROS**: best of TN and IPS

**CONS**: limited amount

#### Conclusion

Dependant on your budget or usage, there are different options to choose for computer monitors. TN panels deliver cheap options with high refresh rates, IPS deliver amazing color accuracy and perfect viewing angles, VA take the best of both and mesh it together for an amazing experience.
