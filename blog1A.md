### Topic - Keyboard Switches (Mechanical)

So following the tune of last week, I will be again talking about some hardware and this week will be focused on topic that I am pretty enthusiastic about, keyboard switches. Specfically, mechanical switches which by definition are "individual key switches with metal springs". 

There are multiple types of mechanical switches and are mainly categorized in 3 styles which are **linear**, **tactile**, and **clicky tactile**.

For this week I will talk about mechanical switches, next week will be on the other keyboard switch which will be the membrane switch.

#### Common Terms

These are just terms I will be using to showcase the types of switches 

- *Operation* Force : how much force is needed to press on the switch, usually the strength of the spring (measured in centinewton **cN**)

- *Activation (Actuation) Point* : where the press is recognized by the computer (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Bottom Out* : pressing a key all the way down til it touches the keyboard chasis

- *Travel Distance* : total distance until key is bottom-ed out (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Tactile Position* : position where you feel a "bump" while pressing the key down, only on tactile and clicky tactile switches, linear switches do not have this


#### Linear Switches

The most basic switch and also the most common switch manufactured 

#### Tactile Switches

The other common switch

#### Clicky Tactile Switches

The final switch
