### Topic - Keyboard Switches (Mechanical)

So following the tune of last week, I will be again talking about some hardware and this week will be focused on topic that I am pretty enthusiastic about, keyboard switches. Specfically, mechanical switches which by definition are "individual key switches with metal springs". 

There are multiple types of mechanical switches and are mainly categorized in 3 styles which are **linear**, **tactile**, and **clicky tactile**.

For this week I will talk about mechanical switches, next week will be on the other keyboard switch which will be the membrane switch.

#### Common Terms

These are just terms I will be using to showcase the types of switches 

- *Operation Force* : how much force is needed to press on the switch, usually the strength of the spring (measured in centinewton **cN**)

- *Activation (Actuation) Point* : where the press is recognized by the computer (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Bottom Out* : pressing a key all the way down til it touches the keyboard chasis

- *Travel Distance* : total distance until key is bottom-ed out (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Tactile Position* : position where you feel a "bump" while pressing the key down, only on tactile and clicky tactile switches, linear switches do not have this

**NOTE:** Also because of how common this brand is, I will be using Cherry MX as the examples when showing and explaining how the key works.

#### Linear Switches

Linear switches are the most common switches manufactured and are the simplest to understand. Simply, pressing the key down a specfic distance will activate the key. This switch is the closest to regular (membrane) switch usage where most people would *bottom out* the key whenever they wanted to press on it. 

Here is a gif of the moving parts of a linear switch (**Cherry MX Red**)

There are 3 styles for linear switches: **Red, Black, and Silver**

Red and Silver both have a lighter operation force 45cN, while Black has a slightly stiffer operation force at 60cN.

Silvers are called "Speed" switches since they have a much shorter actuation point and travel distance (1.2mm and 3.4mm respectively)

Both Red and Black have the same actuation point and travel distance (2mm and 4mm respectively)

So what does this all mean? If you want faster performance, choose Silvers. If you feel Reds press to easily and want some resistance, choose Blacks. Red is the most basic and easy to use one, so choose it if you are not sure what else you like.

#### Tactile Switches

Tactile Switches are a little different compared to Linear Switches with the major change being a tactile bump when pressing on the key. In all cases, when the user presses on the key and feels the bump, the bump is where the actuation point is at. Meaning when the user feels the bump is when the key is recognized by the conmputer as a key press. People who are used to tactile switches will usually press until the bump then continue typing on another key to create the optimal speed of key presses.

There are 2 styles for tactile switches, **Brown and Clear**

Brown is the more common tactile switch and has a lighter operation force at 55cN, while Clear has a slightly stiffer operation foce at 65cN.

They both have the same actuation point and travel distance (2mm and 4mm respectively)

So what does this all mean for tactile switches? If you want feedback for when the key press is recognized by the conmputer, you should get a tactile switch over a linear switch.  Depending on how much strength you can choose a lighter force through Brown and a slightly heavier force with the Clear. Brown's are the most basic after Red, so you will most likely find more Brown switches compared to Clear ones.

#### Clicky Tactile Switches

Clicky tactile switches are the final type of switch and are basically a deviant of the tactile switch. Simply put the difference is that when the actuation point is reached to count as a key press, there is an audible "click" sound. There will still be feedback by touch but also by sound as well. These switches can get loud pretty quickly if someone is very good at typing.

Here is a gif of the moving parts of a clicky tactile switch (**Cherry MX Blue**)

![clickyswitchgif](https://www.dygma.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blue-switch-optimized.gif)

There are 3 main styles of clicky tactile, **Blue, Green, and White**

Blue is the most common clicky switch, at has the lightest operation force at 55cN, while Green and White have a slightly heavier operation at 80cN.

Both the Blue and Green have the same actuation point and travel distance (2.2mm and 4mm respectively), however I could not find the info for the White but I would assume it would be similar.

The last difference is the White switches have a less audible click compared to the Green.

So what does this all mean for clicky switches? If you like to hear the switch go off, then you can choose these types of switches, they are not recommended if you are afraid of making noise or causing disruptions.  Blues are the most common, if you like a slighty heavier force then you can choose Green, and if you do not wanna hear the click too much, you can choose White.

#### Conclusion

There are many types of mechanical switches and in this blog I only have shown the 3 types of 1 brand. Keep in mind that there are other variations that can fit your style of typing more than the ones listed here.  It all depends on what you like. However if you are not sure where to start, I recommend going to the nearest computer electronic shop to see what types of styles fit you the best.  You can really only decide after feeling how the switch is.
