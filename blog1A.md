### Topic - Keyboard Switches (Mechanical)

So following the tune of last week, I will be again talking about some hardware and this week will be focused on topic that I am pretty enthusiastic about, keyboard switches. Specfically, mechanical switches which by definition are "individual key switches with metal springs". 

There are multiple types of mechanical switches and are mainly categorized in 3 styles which are **linear**, **tactile**, and **clicky tactile**.

For this week I will talk about mechanical switches, next week will be on the other keyboard switch which will be the membrane switch.

#### Common Terms

These are just terms I will be using to showcase the types of switches 

- *Operation Force* : how much force is needed to press on the switch, usually the strength of the spring (measured in centinewton **cN**)

- *Activation (Actuation) Point* : where the press is recognized by the computer (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Bottom Out* : pressing a key all the way down til it touches the keyboard chasis

- *Travel Distance* : total distance until key is bottom-ed out (measured in millimeters **mm**)

- *Tactile Position* : position where you feel a "bump" while pressing the key down, only on tactile and clicky tactile switches, linear switches do not have this

**NOTE:** Also because of how common this brand is, I will be using Cherry MX as the examples when showing and explaining how the key works.

#### Linear Switches

Linear switches are the most common switches manufactured and are the simplest to understand. Simply, pressing the key down a specfic distance will activate the key. This switch is the closest to regular (membrane) switch usage where most people would *bottom out* the key whenever they wanted to press on it. 

There are 3 styles for linear switches: Red, Black, and Silver

Red and Silver both have a lighter operation force 45cN, while Black has a slightly stiffer operation force at 60cN.

Silvers are called "Speed" switches since they have a much shorter actuation point and travel distance (1.2mm and 3.4mm respectively)

Both Red and Black have the same actuation point and travel distance (2mm and 4mm respectively)

So what does this all mean? If you want faster performance, choose Silvers. If you feel Reds press to easily and want some resistance, choose Blacks. Red is the most basic and easy to use one, so choose it if you are not sure what else you like.
