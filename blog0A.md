### Topic - Solid State Drives (SSD)

Welcome back, its a new semester and since I had to help some friends and family with building their PC's, I decided to talk about something that is crucial when buying parts for a personal PC.

So I will first explain what an SSD is, then I will talk about the pros and cons of using a SSD vs HDD and a newer technology called NVMe.

#### What is a SSD?

So as stated above, SSD is short for **S**olid **S**tate **D**rive which is a storage device using integrated circuit assembly to store persistent data with flash memory. For a long period after creation it was used as secondary storage, with primary storage being a hard drive. I will go into more detail since it is part of the pros and cons of using SSD vs HDD.

Just a picture of a SSD:

SSD's traditionally use interfaces such as **SATA** (Serial AT Attachment) and **SAS** (Serial Attached SCSI), which are also used for HDD as well. However the newer interfaces such as **mSATA** and **M.2** will provide better performance if the SSD has the capability.

#### HDD?

HDD is short for hard drive, and is the primary storage device on most computers pre-2015. It is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and recevive data from multiple platters which are read by an arm. They are non-volatile storage, meaning that even with no power, it would still retain the data.

#### SSD vs HDD

So which should you choose? SSD or HDD?
I found a graphic from this [site](https://www.securedatarecovery.com/blog/pros-cons-hard-drive-vs-solid-state-drive) showing the pros and cons of SSD vs HDD

The infographic shows that SSD's have higher capacity, better read and write speeds, longer time before failure, smaller size but have a higher cost per GB. The only aspect where HDD is better than SSD is that is much much cheaper compared to SSD at the same capacity level.  Also because HDD's have moving parts (platters and arm) they are more susceptible to physical movements which could mess up the interior.

#### NVMe

What exactly is NVMe?

It stands for Non-Volatile Memory Express or Non-Volatile Memory Host Controller Interface, which is a specification for non-volatile storage that are attached via PCIe.  Majority of this uses NAND flash memory and comes in many forms (SSD's on Mac, M.2 for PC). Its design allows the hardware and software to do parallel tasks to the fullest which leads to reduced I/O overhead and a large performance improvement. 

Currently, I believe this is the best "bang for your buck" in terms of SSD storage if you are planning to build a computer. NVMe has better read/write speeds and is only slightly a bit more expensive when comparing the same capacity.  I do think that a majority of people will be switching to this in the near future as it gets even cheaper and faster.
