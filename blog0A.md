### Topic - Solid State Drives (SSD)

Welcome back, its a new semester and since I had to help some friends and family with building their PC's, I decided to talk about something that is crucial when buying parts for a personal PC.

So I will first explain what an SSD is, then I will talk about the pros and cons of using a SSD vs HDD and a newer technology called NVMe.

#### What is a SSD?

So as stated above, SSD is short for **S**olid **S**tate **D**rive which is a storage device using integrated circuit assembly to store persistent data with flash memory. For a long period after creation it was used as secondary storage, with primary storage being a hard drive. I will go into more detail since it is part of the pros and cons of using SSD vs HDD.

SSD's traditionally use interfaces such as **SATA** (Serial AT Attachment) and **SAS** (Serial Attached SCSI), which are also used for HDD as well. However the newer interfaces such as **mSATA** and **M.2** will provide better performance if the SSD has the capability.

#### HDD?

HDD is short for hard drive, and is the primary storage device on most computers pre-2015. It is an electro-mechanical data storage device that uses magnetic storage to store and recevive data from multiple platters which are read by an arm. They are non-volatile storage, meaning that even with no power, it would still retain the data.
