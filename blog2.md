### Lab 2, learning how to use Ansible


### Other things during the week

In my other class that I'm taking, CIT496P, the LDAP team that I am part is slowly making progress and from there we are able to actually learn how to use LDAP.  Our first sprint ends this coming Monday, and from there we have new tasks that we need to do to progress further in this project.  Its pretty fun so far seeing how things work and stuff.

As for my personal life, my uncle actually got me Borderlands 3, so in my spare time I have been playing that game, and its been pretty fun throughout. He originally got it for me to play with him, but ironically he has been too busy to even download it into his own computer. 

Also, one of the other games that I play alot is Destiny 2, and since there is an upcoming DLC coming to the game in the near future, the company has been putting out more info about the new features that is being implemented.  I'm really excited for that as well since its been one of my main games to play over the summer.
