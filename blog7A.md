### Topic - VPN 

With the whole COVID-19 situation and the order from the state of California for everyone to start doing all their normal tasks at home, my workplace has switched to a different VPN to accomodate a wider range of users. Since this was such a huge thing for the majority of companies to implement for all users doing the work from home, I decided to talk about it. 

#### What is a VPN?

So to start, what is a VPN.  First off, VPN stands for **V**irtual **P**rivate **N**etwork and going off the a quick google search to the wikipedia article states " ... extends a private network across a public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running on an end system (PC, smartphone etc.) across a VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network ... VPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the private network connection is established using an encrypted layered tunneling protocol, and VPN users use authentication methods, including passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN"

Just to quickly summarize, a VPN allows users to connect to another private network (like their conmpany) and send and receive data.  This is significant because in most organizations, access to specific files or folders on the network require users to be connected to that network, either by being on the wireless or connected through ethernet. The VPN allows access to the files and folders even when the personnel is not physically there.

For example CSUN has a VPN called GlobalProtect which lets the students access resources when they are at home. Mainly the resources are the Oviatt Library, which requires authentication before they are able to sign in and read material.

Another example is my current workplace, where we also have a similar VPN setup, where access to specific folders is required for another application to run and do work through. The majority of last week was getting everyone on the this newer VPN since it can accomodate more users due to the large influx of people working from home.

#### Reasons to have a VPN

Normally when you want to access things on the internet, you just connect to your home wifi and boom you have access. But it changes when you are outside your home, and sending data on unsecure public networks expose information to those who could be looking for potential victims.  Being in public also usually means you are sending data on public wireless networks, not private ones, so all the data being transmitted (emails, texts, bank account information) can be eavsdropped. 

When you use a VPN, it uses encryption to scramble the data while its being sent across the network, which makes your data secure and prevents eavsdroppers to easily see the data you are sending.

Here are 5 things that having a VPN helps hide
1. Browsing history 

When you browse the web, everything you do is tracked, either by your ISP or your web browser or even the websites you visit.  Because these sites track you, they can compile your data and force ads for things they think you need which is an invasion of your privacy.  By using a VPN, you mitigate most of these issues, since your information is encrypted.

2. Your IP address and location

Your IP address is shown to yoru ISP and the website you've been to but when you use a VPN, it masks your IP address, and even though you visit the website it does not show your website, it shows the IP address of the VPN.

3. Your location for streaming 

Most streaming services have shows that are region locked and cannot be accessed while in other regions. Because of this using a VPN that allows you to appear in a different location/region will let you access those streaming services.

4. Your devices and web activity

Since your device is the one that must connect to the websites you visit, naturally your devices will be targeted by malicious people that try to exploit your web activity to gain access to information that is valuable to you. Through the encryption that VPN's impose, it makes it very difficult for malicious attacks to happen.
