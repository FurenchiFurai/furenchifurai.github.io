### Topic - Active Directory

Another week, another blog. Funnily enough, you would think that during this StayAtHome orders for everyone, I would be learning more things to write about, but thats not the case so I will be talking more about some things I learned in Office 365 training at work. As stated in the title, I will be talking about Active Directory, a key component of a many corporations and organizations. While my knowledge is very basic, it should be enough to explain some things about it. 

#### What is Active Directory?

So starting off with a definition from [jumpcloud.com](https://jumpcloud.com/blog/active-directory-faq) "Active Directory is a directory service that enables administrators to manage and secure their IT resources. AD stores information about network objects (e.g. users, groups, systems, networks, applications, digital assets, and many others) and their relationship to one another. Admins can use AD to create users and grant them access to Windows laptops, servers, and applications. They can also use AD to control groups of systems simultaneously, enforcing security settings and software updates."

Active Directory, as part of its name, is a directory service from Microsoft which shows the relationships of objects on your organization's network
