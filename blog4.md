# Blog 4 (October 4, 2019)

### Starting on Group Project, no labs this week

So this weeks blog is going to be considerably shorter as we don't have a lab due this week so the majority of my time was learning how to do specific things for the group project.

I believe majority of my group plans on using AWS for our project, so I am just waiting on everyone to have the $100 of credit so we can fully start the processes. 

For the time being, I was looking at some of the labs that our instructor has gave us to give practice. Just some starting AWS labs to help us get familiar with the structure of AWS.


### Other things during the week and following up

So as I said last week, the DLC for my current game Destiny 2, Shadowkeep just came out this Tuesday and so far I have had a lot of fun playing it.  There is alot of new content and the community is doing their best to help all the new players since Destiny 2 is now free to play on Steam.  I have been helping some friends and cousins play the game as well and so far they look like they are enjoying the game as well.  

It is also the time of new TV shows and anime shows, so I am also looking forward to those being streamed on TV and through the various streaming services I have.
