### Topic - Karnaugh Map (K-Map) Part 2

So last weeks blog, we talked about basic Boolean Algebra where there are 3 main operators that are used: **AND**, **OR** and **NOT**.

Just to recap last week's blog, between 2 variables with values of 0 (false) and 1 (true)

The operators function as follows:
- **AND** requires both variables to be 1(true) or the outputs is 0(false)
- **OR** requires only one of the variables to be 1(true) or the output is 0(false) 
- **NOT** just flips the boolean value from 0(false) to 1(true) and 1(true) to 0(false)
