### Topic - Keyboard Switches (the others ...)

So last week, I talked about the different types of mechanical keyboard switches and how you can customize your typing experience with the different combinations of operation forces, actuation point and travel distance. However, mechanical keyboard usage is not very common. Why? Majority of these keyboards are somewhat expensive, with some of the higher end models going up to $200. Besides that unless a family member has a mechanical keyboard to use, most people probably never have heard of a mechanical keybaord.  The most common keyboard is still made with membrane switches (we will get into more detail later) and it is still used in a majority of laptops and desktops around the world.

Since there isn't much to talk about for the membrane switch, I will divide this into 2 sections, one talking about membrane keyboard and the other about another pretty well known and controversial switch, Apple's butterfly switch.
