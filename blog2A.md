### Topic - Keyboard Switches (the others ...)

So last week, I talked about the different types of mechanical keyboard switches and how you can customize your typing experience with the different combinations of operation forces, actuation point and travel distance. However, mechanical keyboard usage is not very common. Why? Majority of these keyboards are somewhat expensive, with some of the higher end models going up to $200. Besides that unless a family member has a mechanical keyboard to use, most people probably never have heard of a mechanical keybaord.  The most common keyboard is still made with membrane switches (we will get into more detail later) and it is still used in a majority of laptops and desktops around the world.

Since there isn't much to talk about for the membrane switch, I will divide this into 2 sections, one talking about membrane keyboard and the other about another pretty well known and controversial switch, Apple's butterfly switch.

#### Membrane Keyboard

So a simple definition of a membrane keyboard from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard):

A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not seperate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface.

So it is a semi large surface that when gets pressed down and conducts when in contact with a lower circuit.

So as in the photo shown above, there are 3 layers
- green layer is the top membrane layer, usually a plastic rubber
- the black layer called "holes", which is basically a layer of space for the red conductive surfaces to have some space so they are not always triggered
- dirty yellow is the bottom membrane which just houses the conductive circuit

**However** this is a little different in laptop keyboards, since there is much less space, so everything is a bit more compact. The membrane keyboard for laptops uses a special switch called the "scissor-switch" which looks something like this:
