### Topic - Keyboard Switches (the others ...)

So last week, I talked about the different types of mechanical keyboard switches and how you can customize your typing experience with the different combinations of operation forces, actuation point and travel distance. However, mechanical keyboard usage is not very common. Why? Majority of these keyboards are somewhat expensive, with some of the higher end models going up to $200. Besides that unless a family member has a mechanical keyboard to use, most people probably never have heard of a mechanical keybaord.  The most common keyboard is still made with membrane switches (we will get into more detail later) and it is still used in a majority of laptops and desktops around the world.

Since there isn't much to talk about for the membrane switch, I will divide this into 2 sections, one talking about membrane keyboard and the other about another pretty well known and controversial switch, Apple's butterfly switch.

#### Membrane Keyboard

So a simple definition of a membrane keyboard from [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membrane_keyboard):

A membrane keyboard is a computer keyboard whose "keys" are not seperate, moving parts, as with the majority of other keyboards, but rather are pressure pads that have only outlines and symbols printed on a flat, flexible surface.

So it is a semi large surface that when gets pressed down and conducts when in contact with a lower circuit.

So as in the photo shown above, there are 3 layers
- green layer is the top membrane layer, usually a plastic rubber
- the black layer called "holes", which is basically a layer of space for the red conductive surfaces to have some space so they are not always triggered
- dirty yellow is the bottom membrane which just houses the conductive circuit

**However** this is a little different in laptop keyboards, since there is much less space, so everything is a bit more compact. The membrane keyboard for laptops uses a special switch called the "scissor-switch" which looks something like this:

The keycap is supported by the switch which is in an X shape, similar to scissors where "opening" the top or bottom will spread the X shape wider and "closing" the top or bottom will make the S shaper narrower. 

Also you can see the switch is above the 3 layers, and in the second part of the picture, when the switch is pressed down, it presses the two circuit bits together and triggers the asscociated key press. 

This leads to our next section about the new Apple keyboard switch, called the butterfly switch.

#### Apple Butterfly Switch

So the image above is the newer Apple laptop's keyboard switch called the butterfly switch because ..... you guessed it, it looks like a butterfly. Go figure

The shape is basically a wide V, that gets pressed down and pops up. This design is much sleeker and thinner than the regular laptop scissor switch, which is good since that was what Apple went for design-wise. However this design is also more detrimental as because its shape allows more dust and debris to fall under the V and cause the key to jam. This is a very common complaint from critics and people who have the newer Apple MacBook models.

Some good news is that there is news that they are planning to going back to the traditional scissor switch design after getting alot of complaints about the butterfly switch seeminly failing more often.
